## Contributing to the Cloudflare API documentation

Thank you for considering contributing to our documentation!

Following these guidelines helps to keep our documentation consistent and deliver the best developer experience for those using them.

There are several ways to contribute to these docs. At this time we are looking for **modest changes** such as typos fixes and other corrections. Large new content contributions are discouraged.

If you have any questions that _aren't_ answered by this contribution guide, let us know! This document, like everything else in this repository, is a work in progress, and we'd love to know how we can make it better.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* [Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch](https://github.com/cloudflare/api-docs/compare).
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you find a typo in the docs, or an issue with a code sample?**

* **Ensure that the issue was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-docs/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/cloudflare/api-docs/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Do you want to add a new section to the docs?**

* Please submit an issue! We're interested in hearing about what you think is missing in the docs, but we aren't accepting submissions that are substantial new sections of the docs.
